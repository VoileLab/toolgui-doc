- Faster access: Frequently used data can be retrieved from the cache much faster than recalculating it or fetching it from an external source every time. This improves the application's overall performance.

- Reduced resource usage: By avoiding redundant calculations and external data fetching, the app can conserve resources like CPU and network bandwidth.
